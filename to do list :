to do list :
- heredoc, cmd after pipe dont have the good behaviour if here is done before
- 'cat access.log | grep "GET" | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > analysis_report.txt
' works only till before '>' redirection. the file is empty.
- 'cat | cat | ls' doesn't work
- memory leaks with echo $? (because of reducing size of the string '$? -> one digit')
- our minishell works with bonus part (echo '"$USER"')
- echo with global variable makes memory leaks
